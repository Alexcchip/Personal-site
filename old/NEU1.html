            Before heading to london in the Spring, I decided that I wanted to learn more about electrical engineering so I joined Northeastern's CubeSat (satellite) club.
            Here I was able to attend a few very interesting talks and workshops, as well as get my hands dirty with some basic bread board work. <br><br>

            Outside of campus, a big part of my exploration of cities involved their museums. <br><b style="font-size:medium;">Boston </b>I found the Monet section of Boston's MFA to be stunning 
            as well as the entirety of the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum, whereas I laughed my way through the ICA.

        <p><b>Fall</b></p>
        <p>My freshman semester started in Boston, MA, where I dived into not only theory and applications of CS, but I was also able to take a philosophy course 
            focused on "[T]he relationship between technology and humanity, the social dimensions of technology, and ethical issues raised by emerging technologies." (<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.coursicle.com/neu/courses/PHIL/1145/">PHIL 1145</a>)
        </p>
        <p><b>Spring</b><br><br>
        During the Spring 2024 semester, I had the privillage to study aborad in London. This was a transformative experience for me, to say the least. I was not only able to 
        experience how higher level math taught is like across the pond (Calculus 3, Linear algebra & Diff Eq), I was able to explore the beautiful city of London and several countries in both Western and Eastern Europe.
        
        The biggest difference between UK and US math was that in the UK, every concept was built from the ground up (often spending entire 1.5 hour periods proving a fundamental identity 
        that is often taken for granted/brushed past).
