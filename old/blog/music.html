    <h1>What do I mean</h1>
    <p>Music always seems to evoke some sort of feeling for me. Depending on the artist and song, I will feel some sort of warmth within me when I hear a certain chorus or part
        of a song. It's almost as if I took some drug, and I am thrown back in time to when I first started listening to this song. That is what I will be talking about here.</p><br>

    <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">LA LA LA LAAAA, ipod touch, Party Rock</h2>
    <p>My first memory of music was when my great aunt would take me in a stroller in midtown east (pre 2010) and sing to me this tune: "LA LA LA LAAAA" [will find the piece]. <br><br>
    But I would say that my first true interactive experience (besides the walking pianos at FAO Schwarz) with music was on my ipod touch. <br><img src="../Assets/Blog/Music/ipod.jpg" alt="black ipod">
    I remember having the itunes/music app on it and only having a few songs since I didn't want to pay $2.99 for a song. One of the songs, which seems to have been predownloaded,
    was <b>Party Rock Anthem</b> by <i>LMFAO</i>, <i>Lauren Bennett</i>, and <i>Goon Rock</i> 2011. These days, when I hear this song I don't really get thrown back to 
    the early 2010s, but I've always found it to be hilarious that this song was seemingly downloaded by default.

    <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">Relationship with music</h2>
    <p>It wasn't till about 2021-2022 when I started to listen to music consistantly and when I started to form my actual taste. I think in middle school I was just listening to 
        J. Cole for some reason. During my sophomore year of high school (2020-2021, remote school), when I wasn't rotting on Valorant or CSGO, I think I was listening to lo-fi. 
        <br><br>During my jr. year of high school I had a lot of free time, and when I wasn't in class or working I was likely taking a nap in the library.
        This is the first example of a period in time that I am often thrown back to when I listen to the music of that time. While napping I would always listen to either
        Mac Miller or Nujabes.

        <br>These days when I listen to these artists I usually get that warm feeling and it almost feels like I am in high school napping or speed reading a text for seminar or 
        some magical realism latin american pieces from my Hinrichs class (favorite class at Bard). Or occasinally I get thrown back to that one time when Jawad and I synced
        our airpods andwalked along the hudson river greenway, that was really a wild night.
